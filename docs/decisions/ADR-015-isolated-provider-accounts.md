# ADR-015: Isolated provider accounts with session profile binding

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The owner clarified that the usage popup must add another account of the same provider, rather than another monitored provider. MonoCode's local implementation uses separate Codex/Claude profiles and pins conversations to their initial profile. A global logout/login switch would also change existing sessions and the user's external CLI. This authorizes a narrow new-profile vendor-login exception to ADR-014's account-management prohibition; its Cursor/Go read-only credential policy and ADR-013's earned-reset rules remain.

## Decision

- `provider_accounts.rs` owns a bounded registry of native-generated profile UUIDs, labels and selected defaults. The renderer supplies only a provider, registered ID or bounded label through five typed create/select/rename/login/cancel commands. No auth token, arbitrary directory, URL, env or process arguments are accepted.
- Codex and Claude named profiles live in private, owner-validated AppData directories. Their fixed child environment selects `CODEX_HOME`, or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` plus `CLAUDE_SECURESTORAGE_CONFIG_DIR`, and removes inherited API/OAuth token variables. The default profile continues using the user's existing environment. Missing or unsafe named profiles fail without fallback.
- Only an explicit user action starts `codex login` or `claude auth login --claudeai` in a new/unused profile. The vendor owns the browser flow and credential storage. The host never imports, copies, logs or returns credentials. Login has null stdin, bounded discarded output, a ten-minute deadline and cancellation/shutdown cleanup of the owned process group. Default login and re-login to a profile used by sessions are rejected. Profile deletion is not offered.
- A session persists its selected profile at creation and retains a per-provider binding when changing providers. Exact native continuation validates profile identity along with the existing project/cwd/model/session identity. Changing the selected account applies to new sessions only. Legacy sessions retain `default`.
- Process execution, quota cache keys and Codex reset offers use the same profile. Reset consumption retains fresh email validation, confirmation, once-only reservation and idempotency. Quota/account snapshots remain memory-only; no polling is introduced.
- Account rows display verified CLI email/plan/quota; missing identity is unverified. Unverified named profiles cannot be selected through the UI; the existing default remains selectable for API-key accounts without email. Management currently means renaming. Cursor/OpenCode have working default-account quotas but no verified isolated multi-account login in these adapters.

## Consequences

Multiple Codex/Claude accounts can coexist without replacing the system login. A session binds a profile rather than a cryptographically immutable vendor identity: external vendor tools can still replace credentials in that directory, especially the shared default. This is an explicit limitation, not a guarantee against external reauthentication. No cloud account or Switchyard login is introduced.

Native regressions cover private paths, foreign IDs, environment isolation, fixed login/cancel, session binding and profile-scoped reset offers. Empty-profile probes against both installed CLIs verified absence of inherited default identity without logging in or running inference. Automated tests exercise login with a disposable process fixture; a real browser login requires the user's participation.

## Alternatives considered

Changing global authentication, copying existing credentials and accepting token input would expand authority and break session ownership. A cosmetic “Add account” button opening provider visibility would repeat the original product error. Offering unverified isolation for Cursor/OpenCode would falsely imply account separation.
