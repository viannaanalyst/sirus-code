# ADR-074: Watch a pull request

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

CI auto-fix (ADR-064) wakes a session only when its PR's checks fail. Reviews and merge conflicts still need the person to notice, open GitHub and write a follow-up. T3 Code's PR watch (pingdotgg/t3code #15057, #16235, #16762) lets a thread watch its PR and wakes the agent on new checks, comments and conflicts, with a wake limit against chatty bots and no polling once a thread settles.

## Decision

A session can watch its own pull request. This is the fourth exception to "turns start from an explicit Send", after automations (ADR-051), the armed resume (ADR-063) and CI auto-fix (ADR-064).

**Opt-in.**

- `AppSettings.prWatch` (Settings → Git, on by default) is the owner switch. While it is off the timer idles and new watches are refused.
- Each watch is per session. It starts from the "Watch PR" row in the Environment card or from the agent's `watch_pull_request` tool, which the agent calls when the person asks it to watch the PR.
- Side chats cannot watch; they share their parent's branch.
- The agent tool lives on the existing per-session MCP bridge (`browser_mcp`), so the token decides the session. It has no arguments: an agent can watch only its own session's PR, resolved through the same read-only probe as the Environment card (`pull_requests::load`). `unwatch_pull_request` stops it.

**Watching.** `pr_watch.rs` runs one native 60-second timer.

- At most 8 PRs are watched at once. Each one is read at most once every 55 seconds, whatever wakes the timer.
- One fixed GraphQL query through the hardened `gh` path (`github_inbox::graphql`) reads the PR state, head, `mergeable`, the latest check rollup and the last 30 reviews with their inline comments. All text is bounded and stripped of control characters.
- Busy sessions are skipped before any GitHub call: a running turn, pending approvals or questions, or an archived session. Events wait, untold, until the session is idle.
- A merged or closed PR removes the watch and notifies the person.

**Deciding.** `evaluate` is a pure, tested function that compares the PR with what the agent was already told.

- **Checks:** a failing check is reported once per PR head. A rerun that fails again is reported again. While CI auto-fix is on and not turned off for the session, failures are left to it, so the session never gets two turns for one failure.
- **Reviews:** a review counts when it is "changes requested", or a comment with a body or inline comments, submitted after the watch started, by someone other than the signed-in `gh` account, and not already seen. Seen review IDs are kept (at most 200). Approvals do not wake.
- **Conflicts:** reported when `mergeable` becomes `CONFLICTING`. `UNKNOWN` (GitHub still computing after a push) keeps the last answer.
- **Bound:** each wake counts. A new PR head resets the count. After 5 wakes in a row without a new head, the watch stops itself with a notice, and the person can watch again.

**Waking.** The session gets one automatic Auto-approval turn (never Full, never planning) that starts with "PR watch:". It lists the failing checks, each review with its author and state, the quoted review text, every inline comment as `path:line` with its quoted text, and a conflict notice naming the base branch. GitHub content is quoted as untrusted data and the prompt is bounded to 24 KiB. Unlike CI auto-fix, Sirus Code does not commit or push afterwards; the agent follows the session's usual rules. If the turn cannot start, the watch stops with a notice.

**UI.**

- The Environment card has a "Watch PR" row. Its badge shows the PR number and a green dot (watching) or an amber dot (stopped). Its popover holds the switch, the watched events with their last seen state, who started the watch, and the last update. A stopped watch offers "Watch again" or "Dismiss".
- On the Pull requests page, a PR watched by sessions shows an eye in its list row. Its Summary lists those sessions with what they watch and a Stop button.
- State lives in `AppData.prWatches`, changes through the closed `pr_watch_action` (status / set), and refreshes on the `pr-watch-changed` event.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Review feedback and conflicts reach the agent without the person relaying them.
  - The agent can arm the watch itself when asked.
  - Polling is bounded: 8 PRs, one query each per minute, and none at all for busy sessions.
- **Negative:**
  - While something is watched, Sirus Code queries GitHub once a minute per PR.
  - Automatic turns run under Auto approval without a per-turn confirmation.
  - Comments by the person's own `gh` account never wake the agent, including the person's own review notes.
  - Edited reviews are not reported again.
  - Conversation comments that are not part of a review are not watched, which keeps deploy and coverage bots from waking the agent.

## Alternatives considered

- **Extending CI auto-fix in place.** Rejected: auto-fix is global and commits and pushes by itself. A review or a conflict needs judgement, so the watch only describes what happened and lets the agent act.
- **Watching conversation comments too (T3 Code).** Rejected for now: bots that post to the conversation would spend the wake budget. The five-wake limit would still cover it if it is added later.
- **A per-tool-call PR number.** Rejected: an argument-free tool bound to the session token cannot be pointed at someone else's PR.
