// Accessibility bridge between AXPTranslator and CoreSimulator.
//
// AXPTranslator drives accessibility reads through a *synchronous* delegate
// callback, while CoreSimulator's transport (`-[SimDevice
// sendAccessibilityRequestAsync:completionQueue:completionHandler:]`) is
// asynchronous. This class is installed as the translator's bridge-token
// delegate and turns each synchronous callback into an async XPC round-trip it
// waits on, which is the same shape idb's FBAXTranslationDispatcher uses.
//
// It lives in Objective-C because conformance is to a private informal protocol
// (`AXPTranslationTokenDelegateHelper`) whose callback returns a block; the
// runtime only checks `-respondsToSelector:`, so no header for the protocol is
// needed.
